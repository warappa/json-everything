# [3.0.3](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/327)

[#325](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/325) - [@jnystad](https://github.com/jnystad) found an issue with `[Nullable]` where it was propagating to other properties of the same type and suggested a fix.

# [3.0.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/301)

[#296](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/296) - Updated handling logic for `[JsonIgnore]` to consider the attribute's `Condition` property.

# 3.0.1 (no PR)

[#288](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/288) - Just bumping version to pick up the latest Json.More.Net by default.  This package pull Json.More.Net transitively via JsonPointer.Net which wasn't updated with the move to `JsonNode`.

# [3.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/280)

Updated all functionality to use `JsonNode` instead of `JsonElement` in line with JsonSchema.Net v3.

## Breaking Changes

_`JsonElement` -> `JsonNode` type exchange changes not listed._

- `IContextContainer.GetContexts()` and implementations removed as it was obsolete
- `TypeExtensions.IsInteger()`, `.IsFloatingPoint()`, and `.IsNumber()` moved to Json.More.Net

# [2.1.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/275)

[#274](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/274) - Added support for `JsonObject`, `JsonArray`, and `JsonValue`.

# [2.2.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/273)

[#272](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/272) - Miscellaneous attributes can cause incorrect optimizations.

Added `SchemaGeneratorConfiguration.Optimize` to control whether common subschemas are collected into `$defs`.

Exposed `SchemaGeneratorConfiguration.Current` static property for read use by custom generators, etc.

# [2.1.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/267)

[#264](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/264) - Added support for `additionalProperties` and `additionalItems`.

Improved support for array types that inherit `IEnumerable<T>` but aren't generic themselves, e.g. `MyList : List<int>`.

Also updated return value of `SchemaGenerationContextBase.Apply()` from `JsonSchemaBuilder` to `JsonSchema`.  This is pretty hidden, so it _shouldn't_ break anyone, thus not strictly adhering to semver for this change.  Calling it out just in case.

# 2.0.1 (No PR)

Exposed `SchemaGenerationContextBase.Hash` property.  Required to implement `IContextContainer.Replace()`.

Marked `IContextContainer.GetContexts()` obsolete as it's not used.

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/261)

[#202](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/202) - Added support for read-only & write-only keywords for properties that only have getters or setters.  The attributes override this detection behavior.

[#256](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/256) - Added support for type-level attributes.

## Breaking changes

- Intents no longer require equality methods (`Equals()` & `GetHashCode()`). ðŸŽ‰
- `SchemaGeneratorContext` replaced by `SchemaGenerationContextBase`, `TypeGenerationContext`, and `MemberGenerationContext`.
    - The "Type" version represents generation of a "pure" type; that is, it's not a member of another type.  This will only handle attributes that are placed on the type itself.
    - The "Member" version represents object members.  This will handle attributes placed on the member.  The `Attributes` property is only present on this version since the type carries the attributes for the other.
- `SchemaGenerationContextCache.Get()` has two overloads, only with member attributes, and one without.  If attributes are supplied, a `MemberGenerationContext` will be returned; otherwise a `TypeGenerationContext` will be returned.
- `SchemaGeneratorConfiguration` converted into a thread-static singleton (the static property is `Current`) for easier access.
- `IAttributeHandler` is now just a placeholder.  Attribute handlers will now need to implement `IAttributeHandler<T>` where `T` is the attribute type.
- `IAttributeHandler.AddConstraints()` now has an `attribute` parameter.

## Other fixes & enhancements

- Added `SchemaGenerationConfiguration.Nullability`.

[#125](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/125) - Bug fix: generation of object with no serializable properties still generates an empty `properties` keyword.
