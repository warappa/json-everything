# A Vocabulary for Accessing Data Stored in JSON

## 1. Purpose

This document describes a vocabulary defining keywords that can be used to reference values stored in

- the instance data
- external JSON data
- the schema data

and use the dereferenced values as input for other keywords.

The intent for this keyword is to cover the use cases discussed across several issues in the JSON Schema specification GitHub repositories.  (A quick search for `"$data"` can readily summon these issues.)

## 2. Declarations

The ID for this vocabulary is `https://gregsdennis.github.io/json-everything/vocabs-data` (the URI to this document).

A draft 2020-12 meta-schema which includes this vocabulary has been defined for convenience.  The ID for the meta-schema is `https://gregsdennis.github.io/json-everything/meta/data`, and it can also be found at this address.

***EDITOR'S COMMENT** Since this page has been moved to `json-everything.net`, these URIs may be updated soon to reflect the new domain.  I'm not sure how to go about versioning them yet.  While I figure that out, the meta-schema should still be available at this address.  The IDs remain the same.*

## 3. The `data` Keyword

### 3.1 Syntax and Semantics

The value of `data` must be an object.  The keys of the object correspond to valid JSON Schema keywords, and the values MUST be valid URI references.

The keys MUST be interpreted and evaluated as if they were keywords specified in the schema or subschema containing `data` and using the values dereferenced by the URI specified for that key.

The set of keywords in the schema or subschema containing `data` SHOULD be distinct from the set of keys defined within `data`.  Behavior in the event of an overlap is not defined.

### 3.2 Contextual Behavior

`data` MUST be processed contextually in accordance with the draft of the schema in which it is used.  For example, if `data` is used in a schema that declares draft 2019-09, then

- the keys SHOULD be recognized by draft 2019-09 or defined in other referenced vocabularies, and
- the URI references MUST be resolved following the same rules as `$ref` as defined by draft 2019-09.

If a key is not a recognized keyword in the schema's draft (e.g. `$dynamicAnchor` in a draft 2019-09 schema), then this key is ignored just as it would be ignored if it were in the schema or subschema containing `data`.

### 3.3 URI Resolution

The instance being validated serves as the initial document for URI resolution.  This case is recognized by a fragment-only URI.  The fragment MUST be a valid JSON Pointer as defined by [RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).

External documents can be referenced using an absolute URI base identifier along with a JSON Pointer fragment.  This has a side effect of being able to reference values within the schema by supplying the schema's `$id` value as the base identifier.

Implementations SHOULD be able to download external JSON documents, but MAY provide means to pre-load and cache such documents against the identifiers by which they will be referenced.

If a URI reference cannot be resolved, validation MUST fail; otherwise the full value at the specified location is returned.  Unlike `$ref`, which requires that the dereferenced value must be a valid schema, the value dereferenced by `data` may be any JSON value.

If the resolved value is not valid for the associated keyword, validation MUST fail.

### 3.4 Errors

The output formatting specified by the JSON Schema Core specification can only indicate that something failed at the `data` node, but there is no provision for providing further detail.

In summary, the `data` keyword can generate two validation failure states as specified by this document:

- a URI reference cannot be resolved, and
- a URI reference can be resolved but the returned value is invalid for the associated keyword.

To make debugging `data` simpler, implementations SHOULD provide an error message indicating what the failure was and for which key it occurred.

If both of these succeed, the validation output of the resulting subschema is reported into the overall schema output as if the subschema were actually a child of the `data` keyword.

## 4. A Short Example

The following defines a schema to validate an object instance with a `foo` property that must contain an integer value less than or equal to the value in the instance's `minValue` property.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gregsdennis.github.io/json-everything/meta/data",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": {
      "type": "integer",
      "data": {
        "minimum": "#/minValue"
      }
    },
    "minValue": {
      "type": "integer"
    }
  },
  "dependentRequired": {
    "foo": [ "minValue" ]
  }
}
```

The `data` property declares that its parent subschema should validate a `minimum` keyword whose value is the value in the `minValue` property of the instance.

Note also the use of `dependentRequired` to ensure that when `foo` is present in the instance, `minValue` is also present.  While this not explicitly required of schema authors, this type of insurance mechanism is recommended.

The following shows how a change in the `minValue` property can affect the validation result of the `foo` property and thus the entire instance.

```json
// passing
{
  "minValue": 5,
  "foo": 10
}

// failing
{
  "minValue": 15,
  "foo": 10
}
```
